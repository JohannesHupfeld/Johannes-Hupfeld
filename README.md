Hey, I am a full stack web developer and graduate of Flatiron School for Software Engineering. Some languages and libraries I am well versed in are Ruby on Rails, JavaScript, React.js and Redux. I am a former social worker and freelancer in video production but finally took the leap and ventured into the world of computer progamming, something I always wanted to be a part of. 

* I am currently working on finishing my CookBook Social Recipes application and deploying it 
* I am also working on deploying my Rails CookBook app 
* I plan further my skills in React.js and Redux
* Currently learning how to use React hooks 
* Learning new languages are a definite goal of mine
